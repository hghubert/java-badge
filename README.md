This is where my work for the Java Badge will be placed.
- StringOutOfMemory is the code to test the how many strings will result in an Out of Memory exception
  - set Heap Size to 100m (-Xmx100m) 
  - In intelliJ this is located under Run | Edit Configurations... in the VM options field

- ReadFileSortAndOutput is the code to read a file with 10k lines and perform operations on it
  - Outputs sorted.txt with the text in sorted order
  - Outputs reversed.txt with the text in reversed order 

- EnumAndExceptions is the code for my own enum and checked and unchecked Exceptions
  - Uncomment the "uncheckedEnumsTest("UNIVERSAL_STUDIOS");" to see the unchecked exception thrown
